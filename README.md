General Ed is not a visual authoring tool for general use. It's a platform for us to build
some of our own tools. It is a structured document editor. It should not leave Mozilla because
that would set unrealistic expectations.

currently implemented demo editors:
* simple SVG editor
* simple 2d hypercard
* family tree builder
* simple 3D hypercard
* boxes and lines editor for simple WebAudio



# Doc server

General Ed comes with a document server
