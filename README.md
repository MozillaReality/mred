# MrEd : the Mixed Reality Editor

This is the source to a visual editor for mixed reality. It is built in react
 and should be compiled and put on a webserver before using.
 
You may want to start by trying a [live demo on Glitch here](https://mred-demo.glitch.me/). To go further you'll want to remix the [glitch itself](https://glitch.com/~mred-demo) and edit the ".env" file and set a password. Then make sure you login with that password inside of MrEd (when running your remix of the glitch).
